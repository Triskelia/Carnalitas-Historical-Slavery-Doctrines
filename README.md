# Carnalitas - Historical Slavery Doctrines

This is a submod for Carnalitas that adds a new setting for the Default Slavery Doctrines game rule: **Full Historical**.

The Full Historical game rule seeds all vanilla CK3 faiths with a doctrine corresponding to their historical tolerance of slavery, as best as I can figure out from research.

## Righteous Faith Slavery

* Criminal in Abrahamic religions (except Adamitism and Insular Christianity where it is Accepted)

Christians, Muslims, and Jews all have long traditions of condemning slavery - at least when it's one of the "righteous faith" being enslaved.

Ireland and Scotland were recorded to continue the practice of keeping slaves until as late as 1200s when the Normans cracked down on it. This was technically "Criminal" under Catholicism, but CK3 uses "Insular Christianity" as a shorthand for polygamy and other stuff the Church didn't like. This is why I'm making slavery Accepted under Insular Christianity.

Slavery is Accepted in Adamitism on the logical grounds that there's no such thing as crime in Adamite belief.

* Shunned in Eastern religions

I mostly couldn't find information about slavery in India except under the Muslim sultanates. It's possible that slavery existed in ancient India but it's a controversial topic. Buddhist and Jain teachings pretty strongly condemn slavery, which indicates that it was practiced but frowned upon. Based on this I'm going with the middle ground of Shunned for the Dharmic religions

Slavery in China was criminalized but in practice happened a lot on the border regions of the Song Empire, so it's Shunned in Taoism (which is itself a a pretty bad representation of the religious diversity of Chinese spiritual practices, but thems the breaks.)

* Accepted in Pagan religions (except for Asatru where it is Shunned)

Most of the pagans on the map are recorded as having taken slaves, especially the African warlords who pretty much started the institution of slavery. I'm not 100% on religions like Bon and Slavic paganism, since I can't find any information on their slave practices, but I'm fairly comfortable applying a blanket "Accepted"

The Norse exception is based on a lack of evidence for Norse enslaving Norse; the bulk of the Viking slave trade was in Slavs, Christians, and other foreigners

## Hostile Faith Slavery

* Accepted in Abrahamic and Pagan religions

It is well attested that Muslims enslaved loads of non-Muslims, which famously led to the Caliphate being subsumed by the slave-ruled Mamluk Sultanate.

Some Christian leaders did denounce slavery, but the majority seem to have turned a blind eye to the practice, with tons of Muslims and Slavs being captured as prisoners of war and traded through Venice and the Byzantine Empire.

I'm not a hundred percent sure whether enslaving pagans is legal in Judaism, but based on the actions of Christians and Muslims I don't think that a theoretical historical Jewish state would be much different.

Pagans were well known for the practice of slavery, see above.

* Shunned in Eastern religions

See above.

* Shunned in Waldensianism

I'm not sure if any historical Waldensians actually owned slaves, but based on their preaching of poverty it seems likely that they would be harsher on the practice than most Christians.

* Criminal in Bogomilism

Bogomilists were even more hardcore on the poverty thing than the Waldensians, condemning all forms of property as evil, never mind slaves.
