# Carnalitas - Historical Slavery Doctrines

This is a submod for Carnalitas that adds a new setting for the Default Slavery Doctrines game rule: **Full Historical**.

The Full Historical game rule seeds all vanilla CK3 faiths with a doctrine corresponding to their historical tolerance of slavery, as best as I can figure out from research.

## Same Religion Slavery
* Criminal in Abrahamic religions (except Adamitism and Insular Christianity where it is Accepted)
* Shunned in Eastern religions
* Accepted in Pagan religions (except for Asatru where it is Shunned)

## Other Religion Slavery
* Accepted in Abrahamic and Pagan religions
* Shunned in Eastern religions
* Shunned in Waldensianism
* Criminal in Bogomilism
